\begin{abstract}
In this paper, we presents \lang{} that intends to provide a two-step modeling approach in component-based software engineering. \lang{} is a formal modeling language where we take \emph{automata}  as basic behavioral units. Equipped with a rich-featured type system and template mechanism, automata are capable to model generic components and connectors. Such components and connectors are organized through \emph{systems}. The language makes it easy to construct complex models with simply reuse of existing elements, where their formal nature are still maintained.

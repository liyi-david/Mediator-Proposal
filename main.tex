\begin{abstract}
In this paper, we propose a new language \lang{} to describe component-based models. \lang{} provides a two-step modeling approach, where we take \emph{automata} as the basic behavioral units. Equipped with a rich-featured type system and template mechanism, automata are capable to model generic components and connectors. Such components and connectors are organized through \emph{systems}. The language makes it easy to construct complex models with simply reuse of existing elements, where their formal nature are still maintained.

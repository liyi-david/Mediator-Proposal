\begin{abstract}
In this paper we propose a new language \lang{} to describe component-based models. \lang{} provides a two-step modeling approach. \emph{Automata}, encapsulated with a interface of ports, is the basic behavior unit. \emph{Systems} make it able to declare automata as components or connectors, and then glue them together as a more complex model. With help of \lang{}, components and systems can be modeled separately, while the formal nature is still precisely guaranteed. Through some simple examples, we show that this new language can be used in various practical scenarios.

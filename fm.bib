abstract = {Knowing how to create domain-specific languages (DSLs) can give you a huge productivity boost. Instead of writing code in a general-purpose programming language, you can first build a custom language tailored to make you efficient in a particular domain. The key is understanding the common patterns found across language implementations. "Language Design Patterns" identifies and condenses the most common design patterns, providing sample implementations of each. The pattern implementations use Java, but the patterns themselves are completely general. Some of the implementations use the well-known ANTLR parser generator, so readers will find this book an excellent source of ANTLR examples as well. But this book will benefit anyone interested in implementing languages, regardless of their tool of choice. Other language implementation books focus on compilers, which you rarely need in your daily life. Instead, "Language Design Patterns" shows you patterns you can use for all kinds of language applications. You'll learn to create configuration file readers, data readers, model-driven code generators, source-to-source translators, source analyzers, and interpreters. Each chapter groups related design patterns and, in each pattern, you'll get hands-on experience by building a complete sample implementation. By the time you finish the book, you'll know how to solve most common language implementation problems.},

abstract = {Coordination languages, such as Reo, have emerged for the specification and implementation of interaction protocols among concurrent entities, manifested as connectors. In this paper, we describe a theoretical justification and a practical proof-of-concept tool for automatically generating partially distributed, partially centralized implementations of Reo connectors. Such implementations have three performance advantages: faster compilation at build time (compared to a purely centralized approach), reduced latency at run time (compared to a purely distributed approach), and improved parallelism at run time (compared to a purely centralized approach). Our theory relies on the definition of a new product operator on constraint automata (Reo's formal semantics), which we use to formally justify distributions of disjoint parts of a coordination scheme over different machines according to several possible motivations (e.g., performance, QoS constraints, privacy, resource availability, and network topology). To exemplify our work, in a case study, we show and explain how a generated connector implementation can be executed.},

abstract = {Scenario-aware dataflow is a formalism to model modern dynamic embedded applications whose behaviour is heavily dependent on input data or the operational environment. Key behavioural aspects are the execution times and energy consumption of a system's components. In this paper, we introduce flexible scenario-aware dataflow : a proper gener-alisation of previous definitions that allows any execution time to be specified as discretely or continuously random or nondeterministic. Additionally, it supports the model-ling of abstract costs like the energy usage of components. We give a formal compositional semantics in terms of net-works of stochastic timed automata. We have implemen-ted support for analysing performance properties of flexible scenario-aware dataflow graphs via simulation and model checking. A number of reduction techniques are applied to make the underlying state spaces tractable for model check-ing. We evaluate the scalability and performance of our new model and implementation on standard benchmarks.},

abstract = {Recent approaches to component-based software engineering employ coordinating connectors to compose components into software systems. For maximum flexibility and reuse such connectors can themselves be composed, resulting in an expressive calculus of connectors whose semantics encompasses complex combinations of synchronisation, mutual exclusion, non-deterministic choice and state-dependent behaviour. To increase the expressiveness of connectors, notions of context-dependent behaviour have been proposed. Context dependency can be used can express the priority of one behaviour over another and the inhibition of actions due to changing context. The notion of context we consider in this paper is given by the pending activities on the ports of a connector. Context-dependent behaviour occurs whenever the choices available to a connector change non-monotonically as its context changes. Capturing context-dependent behaviour in formal models is non-trivial, as it is unclear how to propagate context information through composition. In this paper we present an intuitive automata-based formal model of context-dependent connectors, and argue that it is superior to previous attempts at such a model for the coordination language Reo. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.

@article{TabaeiBefroueiFmsd2016,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 The Author(s)We propose an automated mining-based method for explaining concurrency bugs. We use a data mining technique called sequential pattern mining to identify problematic sequences of concurrent read and write accesses to the shared memory of a multithreaded program. Our technique does not rely on any characteristics specific to one type of concurrency bug, thus providing a general framework for concurrency bug explanation. In our method, given a set of concurrent execution traces, we first mine sequences that frequently occur in failing traces and then rank them based on the number of their occurrences in passing traces. We consider the highly ranked sequences of events that occur frequently only in failing traces an explanation of the system failure, as they can reveal its causes in the execution traces. Since the scalability of sequential pattern mining is limited by the length of the traces, we present an abstraction technique which shortens the traces at the cost of introducing spurious explanations. Spurious as well as misleading explanations are then eliminated by a subsequent filtering step, helping the programmer to focus on likely causes of the failure. We validate our approach using a number of case studies, including synthetic as well as real-world bugs.},

Probabilistic Timed Rebeca (PTRebeca) is introduced as a timed and probabilistic actor-based language for modeling distributed real-time systems with asynchronous message passing. The semantics of PTRebeca is a Timed Markov Decision Process. In this paper, we provide SOS rules for PTRebeca, introduce a new tool-set and describe the corresponding mappings. The tool-set automatically generates a Markov Automaton from a PTRebeca model in the form of the input language of the Interactive Markov Chain Analyzer (IMCA). The IMCA can be used as a back-end model checker for performance analysis of PTRebeca models against expected reachability and probabilistic reachability properties. Comparing to the existing tool-set, proposed in the conference paper, we now have the ability of analyzing significantly larger models, and we also can add different rewards to the model. We show the applicability of our approach and efficiency of our tool by analyzing a Network on Chip architecture as a real-world case study.},

In this paper, we present a new approach to modeling and verification of Reo connectors via Coq, a proof assistant based on higher-order logic and $\lambda$-calculus. Basic notions in Reo, like nodes and channels, are defined by inductive types. By tracing the data streams, we provide a method for simulation of the behavior and output of a given Reo connector. With input constraints specified, connectors' properties can be proved by induction. Furthermore, properties specified in LTL can be verified using a simulation-based model-checking approach.

abstract = {Today, computers are used to control various technical systems in our society. In many cases, time plays a crucial role in the operation of computers embedded in such systems. This thesis is about techniques and tools for the analysis of timing behaviours of computer systems. Its main contributions are in the development and implementation of UPPAAL, a tool designed to automate the analysis process of systems modelled as timed automata. As the first contribution, we present a software package for timing constraints represented as Difference Bound Matrices.We describe in details, all data-structures and operations for DBMs needed in state-space exploration of timed automata, as well as techniques for efficient imple- mentation. In particular, we have developed two normalisation algorithms to guarantee termina- tion of reachability analysis for timed automata containing constraints on clock differences, that transform DBMs according to not only maximal constants of clocks as in algorithms published in the literature, but also difference constraints appearing in the automata. The second contribu- tion of this thesis is a collection of low level optimisations on the internal data-structures and algorithms of UPPAAL to minimise memory and time consumption. We present compression techniques to allow the state-space of a system to be efficiently stored and manipulated in main memory. We also study super-trace and hash-compaction methods for timed automata to deal with system-models for which the size of available memory is too small to store the explored state-space. Our experiments show that these techniques have greatly improved the performance of UPPAAL. The third contribution is in partial-order reduction techniques for timed-systems. A major problem in automatic verification is the large number of redundant states and transi- tions introduced by modelling concurrent events as interleaved transitions.We propose a notion of committed locations for timed automata. Committed locations are annotations that can be used for not only modelling of intermediate states within atomic transitions, but also guiding the model checker to ignore unnecessary interleavings in state-space exploration. The notion of committed locations has been generalised to give a local-time semantics for networks of timed automata, which allows for the application of existing partial order reduction techniques to timed systems.},

abstract = {We propose timed (finite) automata to model the behavior of real-time systems over time. Our definition provides a simple, and yet powerful, way to annotate state-transition graphs with timing constraints using finitely many real-valued clocks. A timed automaton accepts timed words-infinite sequences in which a real-valued time of occurrence is associated with each symbol. We study timed automata from the perspective of formal language theory: we consider closure properties, decision problems, and subclasses. We consider both nondeterministic and deterministic transition structures, and both B??chi and Muller acceptance conditions. We show that nondeterministic timed automata are closed under union and intersection, but not under complementation, whereas deterministic timed Muller automata are closed under all Boolean operations. The main construction of the paper is an (PSPACE) algorithm for checking the emptiness of the language of a (nondeterministic) timed automaton. We also prove that the universality problem and the language inclusion problem are solvable only for the deterministic automata: both problems are undecidable (??11-hard) in the nondeterministic case and PSPACE-complete in the deterministic case. Finally, we discuss the application of this theory to automatic verification of real-time requirements of finite-state systems. ?? 1994.},

abstract = {The study of composed software and its properties is in itself a great challenge. Bringing quantitative aspects into the picture increases the complexity of the analysis and entails the need for reconciling both the classical and the stochastic analyses. The quest herein is to provide constructs for com-position of building blocks and semantic models thereof which enable both analyses and allow for modeling and verification. Stochastic Reo offers constructs for component and service coordina-tion and provides means for specification of stochastic values for software connectors. Interactive Markov chains (IMC) on the other hand, are a stochastic, compositional, extension of classical mod-els of concurrency, integrating classical and stochastic aspects. This paper discusses how IMC can be effectively used as a compositional semantic model for Stochastic Reo, avoiding to resort to a separate automaton model, often lacking full compositionality, as intermediate semantics. A tool chain integrating available tool support for IMC, is described and applied in the analysis of a case study dealing with performance and resource allocation of a mediation system.},

abstract = {We present the Esterel programming language which is especially designed to program reactive systems, that is systems which maintain a permanent interaction with their environment: real-time process controllers, communication protocols, man-machine interface drivers, etc. Esterel is a deterministic concurrent programming language. It differs from classical asynchronous languages by its synchrony hypothesis: the outputs of a system are conceptually synchronous with its inputs. The synchrony hypothesis permits a high-level modular programming style simpler and more rigorous than its asynchronous counterpart. We present the imperative primitives of Eesterel and the temporal manipulations they permit. We give a small programming example. We present two mathematical semantics of Eesterel, which are given by conditional rewrite rules and related by a correctness theorem. The behavioral semantics defines the behavior of programs in an uneffective way as the solution of fixpoint equations. The effective execution semantics computes actions to be performed by a conceptually infinitely fast execution machine. To relate the two semantics, we solve the causality problems that are inherent in synchronous formalisms. We show how the Eesterel v2 and Eesterel v3 compilers efficiently translate concurrent Eesterel programs into efficient equivalent sequential automata that can be implemented in conventional sequential languages. We discuss the quality of this object code and the practical adequacy of the synchrony hypothesis. ?? 1992.},

abstract = {In this paper we discuss the application of a range of techniques to the verification of mission-critical flight software at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. For this type of application we want to achieve a higher level of confidence than can be achieved through standard software testing. Unfortunately, given the current state of the art, especially when efforts are constrained by the tight deadlines and resource limitations of a flight project, it is not feasible to produce a rigorous formal proof of correctness of even a well-specified stand-alone module such as a file system (much less more tightly coupled or difficult-to-specify modules). This means that we must look for a practical alternative in the area between traditional testing and proof, as we attempt to optimize rigor and coverage. The approaches we describe here are based on testing, model checking, constraint-solving, monitoring, and finite-state machine learning, in addition to static code analysis. The results we have obtained in the domain of file systems are encouraging, and suggest that for more complex properties of programs with complex data structures, it is possibly more beneficial to use constraint solvers to guide and analyze execution (i.e., as in testing, even if performed by a model checking tool) than to translate the program and property into a set of constraints, as in abstraction-based and bounded model checkers. Our experience with non-file-system flight software modules shows that methods even further removed from traditional static formal methods can be assisted by formal approaches, yet readily adopted by test engineers and software developers, even as the key problem shifts from test generation and selection to test evaluation. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

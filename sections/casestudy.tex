\section{Case Study}
\label{sec:casestudy}

In modern distributed computing frameworks (e.g. MPI\cite{mpibook} and ZooKeeper\cite{JunqueiraZab2011}), \emph{leader election} plays an important role to organize multiple servers efficiently and consistently. This section shows how a classical leader election algorithm is modeled and reused to coordinate other components in \lang{}.

\cite{HagitDistributed2004} proposed a classical algorithm for a typical leader election scenario, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:leaderelection}. Distributed processes are organized as an \emph{asynchronous unidirectional} ring where communication takes place only between adjacent processes and following certain direction (indicated by the arrows on edges in Fig. \ref{fig:leaderelection} (a)).

	\label{fig:leaderelection}
\end{figure}

The algorithm has the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Each process sends a voting message including its own \emph{id} to its successor.
	\item A process, when receives a voting message, will
	\begin{itemize}
		\item forward the message to its successor if it contains a larger \emph{id} than itself,
		\item ignore the message if it contains a smaller \emph{id} than itself, and
		\item take itself as a leader if it contains the same \emph{id} with itself, and send an acknowledgement message to this successor, which will be spread over around the ring.
	\end{itemize} 
\end{enumerate}

Here we formalize this algorithm through a more general approach. Leader election is encapsulated as the \texttt{election\_module}. A computing module \texttt{worker},  attached to the \texttt{election\_module}, is an implementation of the working process. 

Two types of messages, \texttt{msgVote} and \texttt{msgLocal}, are supported when formalizing this architecture. Voting messages \texttt{msgVote} are transferred between the processes. A voting message carries two fields, \emph{vtype} that declares the stage of leader election (either it is still voting or some process has already been acknowledged) and \emph{id} is an identifier of the current leader (if it exists). On the other hand, \texttt{msgLocal} is used when a process communicates with its corresponding worker.
\begin{example}[The Election Module] The following automaton shows how the election algorithm is implemented in \lang{}. Due to the space limit, we omit some transitions here. A full version can be found at \cite{medmodels}.
\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\scriptsize\ttfamily]
automaton <id:int> election_module ( left : in msgVote, right : out msgVote,
	query : out msgLocal
) {
	variables {
		leaderStatus : enum { pending, acknowledged } init pending;
		buffer : (voteMsg | NULL) init {vtype: vote, id:id};
		leaderId : (int | NULL) init null;
	}
	transitions {
		(buffer != null)&&(buffer.vtype == vote)&&(buffer.id < id) -> {buffer := null;}
		(buffer != null)&&(buffer.vtype == vote)&&(buffer.id == id) -> {buffer.vtype := ack;}
		(buffer != null)&&(buffer.vtype == ack)&&(buffer.id < id) -> {
			// restart voting if the acknowledged leader has a smaller id
			buffer := { vtype: vote, id: id };
		}
		(buffer != null)&&(buffer.vtype == ack)&&(buffer.id >= id) -> {
			leaderStatus := acknowledged;
			leaderId := buffer.id;
			buffer := buffer.id == id ? null : buffer;
		}
	}
}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{example}


The following code fragment encodes a parallel program containing 3 \emph{worker}s and 3 \emph{election\_module}s to organize the \emph{worker}s. It is a simplified version of the one in Fig. \ref{fig:leaderelection}. In this example, we do not focus on the implementation details on \emph{worker}s. Instead, we hope that any component with a proper interface could be embedded into this system. Consequently \emph{worker} is taken as a parameter of interface type.

\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\scriptsize\ttfamily]
system <worker: interface (query:in msgLocal)> parallel_instance() {
	components {
		E1 : election_module<1>;
		E2 : election_module<2>;
		E3 : election_module<3>;
		C1, C2, C2 : worker;
	}	
	connections {
		Sync<msgVote>(E1.left, E2.right);
		Sync<msgVote>(E2.right, E3.left);
		Sync<msgVote>(E3.right,	E1.left);
		
		Sync<msgLocal>(C1,query,  E1.query);
		Sync<msgLocal>(C2,query,  E2.query);
		Sync<msgLocal>(C3,query,  E3.query);
	}
}
\end{lstlisting}

As we are modeling the leader election algorithm on a synchronous ring, only synchronous communication channels \emph{Sync}s are involved in this example. The implementation details of \texttt{Sync} can be found in  \cite{medmodels}.

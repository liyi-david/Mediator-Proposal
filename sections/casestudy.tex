\section{Case Study}
\label{sec:casestudy}

In modern distributed computing frameworks (e.g. MPI and ZooKeeper), \emph{leader election} plays an important role to organize multiple servers efficiently and consistently. This section shows how a classical leader election algorithm is modeled and easily used to coordinate other components in \lang{}.

 \cite{HagitDistributed2004} proposed an classical algorithm for a typical leader election scenario, as shown in Figure. \ref{fig:leaderelection}. Distributed processes are organized as a \emph{asynchronous unidirectional} ring where communication take place only between adjacent processes and following certain direction (from left to right in this case).

\end{figure}

The algorithm mainly includes the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item To begin with, each process sends a voting message including its own \emph{id} to its successor.
	\item A process, when receives a voting message, will
	\begin{itemize}
		\item forward the message to its successor if it contains a larger \emph{id} than itself,
		\item ignore the message if it contains a smaller \emph{id} than itself, and
		\item take itself as a leader if it contains the same \emph{id} with itself.
	\end{itemize} 
\end{enumerate}

Here we formalize this algorithm through a more general approach. Leader election is encapsulated as \texttt{connector} since it is also responsible to handle the communication between processes. A computing module \texttt{main} is attached to the connector, and used to model computing tasks. 

Two types of messages, \texttt{msgVote} and \texttt{msgLocal}, are supported when formalizing this architecture.
\begin{example}[Definition of Message Types]
Voting messages \texttt{msgVote} are transferred between the connectors. A voting message carries two fields, \emph{vtype} that declares the stage of leader election (either it is still voting or some process has already been acknowledged) and a \emph{id} an identifier of the current leader (if have).
\begin{lstlisting} 
typedef struct { vtype: enum {vote, ack}, id: int } as msgVote;
typedef struct {
	status : enum { pending, acknowledged },
	idLocal : int,
	idLeader : int | NULL
} as msgLocal;
\end{lstlisting}
\end{example}


\begin{lstlisting}
automaton <id:int> election_module (
	left  : in msgVote,  right  : out msgVote,
	query : in msgLocal, notice : out msgLocal
) { ... }

system cluster_instance() {
	components {
		E1 : election_module<1>; E2 : election_module<2>;
		E3 : election_module<3>;
		C1, C2, C2 : worker;
	}	
	connections {
		Sync<msgVote>(E1.left,  E2.right);
		Sync<msgVote>(E2.right, E3.left );
		Sync<msgVote>(E3.right, E1.left );
		
		Sync<msgLocal>(C1,query,  E1.query );
		Sync<msgLocal>(C1,notice, E1.notice);
		Sync<msgLocal>(C2,query,  E2.query );
		Sync<msgLocal>(C2,notice, E2.notice);
		Sync<msgLocal>(C3,query,  E3.query );
		Sync<msgLocal>(C3,notice, E3.notice);
	}
}
\end{lstlisting}
